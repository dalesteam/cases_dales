Case inspired by, but NOT equal to:

Barbaro et al. (JGR: Atmospheres, 2014,doi:10.1002/2013JD021237)

Note that:

(1) For simplicity we prescribe a constant aerosol properties (rather than a diurnal cycle as shown in Barbaro2014 - Fig.1)
(2) Fig.3 is used as inspiration for the evaluation of this run.
(3) The comparison is performed between DALES 4 and further developments (not between paper and further developments)
