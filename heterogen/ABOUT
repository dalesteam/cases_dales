This case uses both chemistry and heterogeneous (prescribed) surface forcings

The numerical experiment (002) is based on the HET numerical experiment presented by Ouwersloot et al. (2011) (http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/11/10681/2011/acp-11-10681-2011.html)
To make it a faster run, the horizontal resolution is made more coarse (from 50 m to 100 m) and the horizontal direction over which is averaged for statistics is halved. This leads to 8 times less grid points
Results can be comparable to those presented in the reference paper or, in more detail, using the data provided in the output folder

Note that there will be slight differences (e.g. in resolved TKE) due to decreased resolution and lowered domain size (in x-direction)
