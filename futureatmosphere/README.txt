The cases have run on DALES version 4.1.

Case R600: CURRENT run: current conditions, asymmetrical stomatal response (5min close, 10 min open) to atmospheric perturbations
Case R992: TEMPERATURE run: increased initial air temperature profile with 2K. Relative humidity maintained similar as R600, so moisture profile is different. Rest similar as R600.
Case R963: CARBON run: increased initial CO2 profile with 200 ppm.  Rest similar as R600.
Case R013: FUTURE run: increased initial CO2 profile with 200ppm and initial air temperature profile with 2K. Thus, combination of R992 and R963. Relative humidity has been maintained similar as R600. Rest similar as R600.
